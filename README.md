Project Description
-------------------
In this project we are attempting to implement Convolutional Neural Networks. This exercise is previously done in MATLAB. 
The trained weights are extracted from running the MATLAB code and the inputs are taken from the MATLAB code as well. 
The neuron activation point is result of sigmoid or ReLu function which is defined in the python code. 

The input image is 20x20 pixel image which is given to the input neurons of this neural net. 
There are 400 input neurons, 25 hidden layer neurons and 10 output neurons. There is bias in the hidden layer and input layer.
